I've given the framework for unit 3 for algebra 2 to..an instance of gemini3pro in aistudio, and and the framework for unit3 for apstats to notebooklm.  .. i've got an instance of ChatGPT5.2 pro with ALL questions in topic 3 for algebra 2, loaded up.. and instance of gemini3 witih all question sin unit3 of apstats loaded up.. and an instance of gemini3 with the final exam for topic 3 of algebra 2 loaded up.
